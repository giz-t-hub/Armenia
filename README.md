### Studies and research papers <a name="studies-research"></a> 

- <b> Connectivity, Road Quality, and Jobs : Evidence from Armenia </b>: Nino Pkhikidze / World Bank, July 2024: https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099439407102418802/idu162e4ac57105bb14438185e3120f86105af03 - *Good road infrastructure decreases travel time and improves accessibility to urban areas. Improved rural-urban linkages could also affect rural employment through decreased time and travel costs. To study this link, the paper analyzes the impact of good quality roads on agricultural and non-agricultural jobs in Armenia, using different sets of data and different methodological approaches. The results show that a shorter 
distance to a good quality road has a statistically significant positive impact on overall non-agricultural employment for men and women, increasing the likelihood of cash-earning jobs for rural women and skilled manual and non-seasonal employment for rural men.*
